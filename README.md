### Hi! I'm @ADFuji, and i'm a computer science student.
I have been developing small personal projects for 1 and a half years and currently I have as a project :
- A task manager to manage at best a development team
- A kind of discord like called Dystopia

I like C++, java, javascript and I'm starting php!
